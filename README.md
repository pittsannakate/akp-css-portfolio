This portfolio is kind of a disaster but let's go with it

The navigation works, but that's about the only thing that does. I struggled with the flex box situation- I tried to do a hover over to have the titles over them, it obviously didn't work. Additionally, I tried to have the first image larger several different ways, but that did not work either. However, the images seem to work okay, but they aren't linked to anything, because i don't have anything to link them to? I know it's in the acceptance criteria but I just dont have anything. I need to figure out how to have the hover go over only part of the flex box to do them per image.

However, the contact looks decent as well. Clearly I'm somewhat delirious based on the time of day this is. 

I also have no idea how to put a screenshot on here? 

However, I hope once I learn how to do those things I can actually use this as a portfolio? hopefully?
